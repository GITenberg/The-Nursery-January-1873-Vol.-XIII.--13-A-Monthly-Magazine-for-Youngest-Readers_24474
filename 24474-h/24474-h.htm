<div class="figleft" style="width: 95px;">

</div><div class='unindent'><br />E are little English sparrows. We have been
two years in America. We were brought over
by Mr. Wakefield's gardener. He let us loose
in the grove; and there we have been ever
since.</div>

<p>Mr. Wakefield has built little houses for us, and put them
on the boughs of the trees. We go into these houses when
it rains hard or blows. Once the doors of our houses were
all blocked up with snow.</p>

<p>The winters here are much colder than in England, where
we were born. More snow falls, and thicker ice forms here.
But we like our new home very well.</p>

<p>Many young sparrows have been born to us. They are
proud of being Americans. They think they are cleverer
than their parents, because their parents, you see, are
English. Pride is not right, is it?</p>

<p>There is a bird called the butcher-bird,&mdash;a very savage
bird,&mdash;that tries to kill us. We have to look out for these
butcher-birds. But they cannot get into our houses: the
doors are too small for them.</p>

<p>There is a little bird called the snow-bird, that comes in
winter. We are not afraid of him. He is afraid of us.
We drive him away when Emily feeds us all. Emily calls
us naughty when we do this: she threatens to punish us
for it.</p>

<p>Emily and her folks live not far from our grove. Emily
has a father and mother, a grandfather, a brother Philip, and
a baby sister, whose name is Nelly. Grandfather and Nelly
are great friends. Grandfather brings Nelly in his arms to
see Emily and Philip feed us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>One day, just as it had begun to snow, we thought we
would fly over and make a call on Emily. She saw us from
the window, and came out. Philip came too. They gave
us crumbs and seed. Grandfather brought baby to see us.
We did not fly off when baby said, "Goo!" We were not
afraid.</p>

<p>By and by two saucy snow-birds came, and tried to get
some of our seed. We flew at them, and drove them off.
But Emily said, "You naughty sparrows! Let those snow-birds
be! They are as good as you are, any day."</p>

<p>Now, that was not kind in Emily. We think we are
better and handsomer than snow-birds. We were so much
offended, that we all flew away, and left her with her precious
snow-birds.</p>

<p>But the next day we were hungry: so we forgave her,
and made her a visit. She was glad enough to see us. So
were grandfather and baby. Those hateful snow-birds kept
out of the way.</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE TEACHER.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Little Mary</span> is seven years old. She loves "The Nursery."
She has read it for nearly three years; and her
mother says she has learned more from it than she has
learned at school.</p>

<p>At first she used to look at the pictures, and ask her
brother Cecil to read to her about them. Oh, how happy
they were reading together! By and by she began to try
to read the story she had just heard; and soon she learned
to read to herself very well.</p>

<p>A black man named John has lived with Mary's father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
many years. He could not read. Mary felt sorry for John.
She thought he would like to read nice stories too.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus08.png" width="400" height="305" alt="Teaching John to read" title="Teaching John to read" />
</div>

<p>One day she said, "Mamma, may I teach John to read?"
"Yes, dear," said her mother, "if you can."</p>

<p>After tea, Mary's mother looked into the kitchen; and
what do you think she saw? John was holding little Mary
on his knee, and she was teaching him to read.</p>

<p>She was pointing to the letters, one by one, and trying
patiently to make him remember his A, B, C; and John,
with his eyes fixed upon the book, was giving close attention
to the words of his little teacher. It was a pretty picture.</p>

<p>Mary did not give up trying until John had learned to
read, though it took a long time, and she had to give him
many lessons. He tried hard to learn; and now he is glad
that he can read, and Mary is glad too.</p>

Santa Claus has filled them,&mdash;yes, from top to toe;<br />
Purple, gold, and crimson, paint the fallen snow,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On Christmas Day, so early in the morning.</span><br />
<br />
Earnest little whispers from the cosey bed;<br />
Busy little footsteps pattering overhead;<br />
Down the stairs they wander, to sweet music wed,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On Christmas Day, so early in the morning.</span><br />
<br />
Dolls and drums and trumpets, what a sight to see!<br />
Whips and tops and tea-sets,&mdash;one for you and me;<br />
Blooming in the corner, such a Christmas-tree,&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">On Christmas Day, so early in the morning.</span><br />

Bells up in the steeples; hark! they sweetly tell<br />
How the blessed Saviour loves the children well;<br />
And they sing the glories that long since befell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On Christmas Day, so early in the morning.</span><br />
<br />
Wee, soft, fairy footsteps outside in the hall,<br />
Then the words of baby musically fall,&mdash;<br />
"Going to kiss my papa, first one of them all!"<br />

<h2>KATY'S CHRISTMAS-PRESENTS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Poor</span> Katy Carr was an invalid. She had to lie in bed
all the time; for not long ago she had a bad fall from a
swing, and hurt her spine.</p>

<p>But Katy had brothers and sisters. There was Clover,
the little girl, who, in the picture, is seen looking over the
head of the bed, behind the pillow. There was Elsie, who
is seen hugging Katy.</p>

<p>Sister Joanna is the girl with black curls, who stands with
a stocking in her hand. Brother Phil, not yet old enough
for trousers, stands at her side; and that boy with his hand
on the knob of the bedpost is Dorry.</p>

<p>It is Christmas morning; and the children have brought
in presents for poor sick Katy. Observe that nice large
chair with a long-cushioned back, ending in a footstool, and
which tips back so as to be just like a bed: that is a present
from Katy's father.</p>

<p>See that little evergreen-tree planted in a red flower-pot:
the boughs are hung with oranges and nuts, and shiny red<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
apples, and pop-corn balls, and strings of bright berries.
These are all presents from the children. A little silver bell,
with "Katy" engraved on the handle, is among the pretty
things.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 438px;">
<img src="images/illus11.png" width="438" height="600" alt="Presents for poor sick Katy" title="Presents for poor sick Katy" />
</div>

<p>Then there is a new book, which you may spy out if you
will look sharp. How the children do enjoy seeing dear
Katy happy! They have all had presents themselves; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
they will soon show them to her. They hope she will be
well enough to play with them before spring.</p>

<p>These children used to have rare frolics among themselves.
On St. Valentine's eve, they had many letters,
most of which, I think, must have been written by Katy.</p>

<p>But among them there was one from Little Red Riding
Hood, over whose sad fate Joanna used to cry. As many
other children have heard about Red Riding Hood, they will
be glad to have good news of her. Here is her letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I send you my picture, dear Johnnie, to show that I'm just as alive as you,
and that you needn't cry over my fate any more, as you used to do. The wolf
didn't hurt me at all that day; for I kicked and fought and cried, till he dropped
me out of his mouth, and ran away in the woods to hide.</p>

<p>And grandma and I have lived ever since in the little brown house so small,
and churned fresh butter, and made cream-cheeses, nor seen the wolf at all. So
cry no more for fear I'm eaten: the naughty wolf is shot, and, if you will come to
tea some evening, you shall see for yourself, I'm <i>not</i>.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">Yours</span>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Red Riding Hood</span>.<br />
</div></div>

<p>If you would like to hear more about the Carr children,
you will find their full history most charmingly written in
a book called "What Katy Did;" a story by Susan Coolidge,
nicely illustrated by Addie Ledyard, and published by
Roberts Brothers.</p>

<h2>LITTLE MISCHIEF.</h2>


<div class='center'>I.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I shall</span> tell you some stories about a little girl whose
name was Bessie Allen. She was so fond of being busy,
that she sometimes got into sad scrapes. So people called
her Little Mischief.</p>

<p>One day she thought her papa's hat looked rough and
rusty: so what did she do but wash it with a sponge wet
in water. She thought she was making the hat look quite
nice and shiny; but she nearly spoiled it.</p>

<p>Her father did not like it at all when he found what she
had done. He loved his little girl; but he thought her
much too meddlesome.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus14.png" width="400" height="371" alt="Painting Carlos&#39; face" title="Painting Carlos&#39; face" />
</div>


<div class='center'><br />II.</div>

<p>One day Bessie was at her aunt's house when the folks
were away. But Carlo the dog was at home; and Bessie
had her doll Cornelia to play with. At last she placed Cornelia
up on the arm-chair with her arms over the back.</p>

<p>Then seeing near by an inkstand, and a bottle of gum
with a brush in it, Bessie thought she would amuse herself
by painting Carlo's face with ink. This was very silly, and
Carlo seemed to think so; for he struggled, and tried to get
away.</p>

<p>The brush tickled him; he did not like to taste of the
ink: at last he broke away, and hid himself under the
sofa.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus15.png" width="400" height="367" alt="Ink on her dress" title="Ink on her dress" />
</div>


<div class='center'><br />III.</div>

<p>Bessie had a piece of biscuit in her pocket. She took it
out, and offered it to Carlo. It was so nice to get biscuit
without having to stand on his hind-legs first, or jump a
great height, or do something funny to earn it, that Carlo
came out.</p>

<p>Then Bessie seized him, and tried once more to ink his
face; but this time Carlo tore himself loose, and ran out of
the room, knocking over the stool on which stood the inkstand,
as he went.</p>

<p>In trying to stop him, Bessie soiled her nice white frock;
and the ink streamed over the carpet. Here was mischief.</p>

<p>Next month I will tell you more stories about Bessie Allen.</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span> came here last night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">On his flight.</span><br />
Down the chimney-top he flew:<br />
He had lots of work to do,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Well he knew.</span><br />
<br />
So he heaped the stockings high,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Said "Good-by."</span><br />
Now, of toys he had no lack:<br />
They were carried on his back,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In a sack.</span><br />
<br />
What did little Flora find?&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Flora kind.</span><br />
Why, a doll with golden hair,<br />
Candies, and a tiny chair,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 3em;">I declare!</span><br />
<br />
What did bright-eyed Georgie get?&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Mamma's pet.</span><br />
Can't you guess? A tiny gun;<br />
But you see it's only one<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Made for fun.</span><br />

<h2>BECKY.</h2>

<h3>A TRUE STORY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> I had finished reading "The Nursery" to my little
Willy to-night, he said, "Please, mamma, now tell me the
story about the cat you had when you were a little girl;
then I will go to bed."</p>

<p>When I had told him the story, as I have told it a great
many times before, he said, "Mamma, why don't you send
that story to 'The Nursery,' so that some other little boy
can hear it too?"</p>

<p>"Why, Willie!" said I: "do you think it is enough of a
story to put in print?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do!" said he. "I like it; and I ought to
know what little boys like. Now, promise me to send it;
and then I will go to bed." So I promised.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>And now that my little boy has said his prayers, and is
nicely tucked in bed, I will write out the story, hoping it
will amuse some other little Willy as much as it does mine.</p>

<p>Here it is, just as I tell it to him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When I was quite young, I had a cat to which I gave the name of Becky. I
know nothing of her very early history, for she was a sober pussy when she was
given to me; but she soon became a great pet in the family, and seemed very fond
of us all, particularly of my father.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus18.png" width="400" height="315" alt="Cat and kittens" title="Cat and kittens" />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>She always showed great delight when he came home after a long absence.
She would put her paws on his shoulders, and rub his face, and purr in a most
contented manner. She would never eat a mouse until she had first carried it to
him; and after he had stroked her, and called her a good pussy, she would go away
quite happy.</p>

<p>After a time she had two beautiful kittens. When they were large enough to
follow her about, I used to give them warm milk from the pail that was brought
in from milking; but one morning, when the pail was set on the floor, the kittens
were too hungry to wait for the milk to be dipped out for them, and, putting their
paws on the side of the pail, began to lap from the top</p>

<p>Becky sat quietly washing her face; but she saw what the kittens were doing,
and thought it was her duty to give them a lesson in good manners: so she walked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
up to them, and boxed their ears till they ran away mewing piteously. They never
again tried to lap milk from the pail.</p></div>

<p>"Tell me something else about Becky," Willy always
says when I get to this point. So I go on:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Becky was not so strict about her own manners. She would often surprise us
by walking into our rooms without stopping to rap, or even to say <i>mew</i>; for she could
open any door in the house by raising the latch with her paw.</p>

<p>She had several families of kittens. Once her whole family was one poor little
thing, which lived only a few days. Becky was grieved sadly at its death; but,
after mourning for some time, she went into the field and caught a mouse, which
she adopted, and treated like a kitten.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus19.png" width="400" height="328" alt="A lesson in good manners" title="A lesson in good manners" />
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>After Becky had been with us a long time, my brother was taken sick; and, as
he reclined in an easy-chair, she used to lie for hours beside him.</p>

<p>One day, a short time after he died, she entered the room, and, jumping up in
the chair, examined it all over. Then she jumped down and sat on the floor,
looking at the chair, and mewing sorrowfully. Then she went away; and we never
saw poor Becky again, or knew what became of her.</p></div>

<p>"What do you <i>suppose</i> became of her?" is Willy's question
here. "Ah, little boy! you can <i>suppose</i> as well as I."</p>

<h2>ROBERT'S PROMISE TO SANTA CLAUS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Robert's</span> hope was that he should have a sled. "O Santa
Claus!" said he, "if you will only bring me a sled, I will
promise to give all your other presents away to those who
need them most."</p>

<p>Uncle Charles heard this speech, and said, "May I send
word to Santa Claus of your promise?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you may," said Robert; "for I am in earnest about
it. If Santa Claus will only bring me a sled, I shall be
content."</p>

<p>"And you will bestow his other Christmas-gifts on those
who need them most,&mdash;is that the bargain?" asked Uncle
Charles.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is it," said Robert.</p>

<p>The little boy went to sleep that night, wondering who
Mr. Santa Claus was, and whether he would heed a hint
from Uncle Charles.</p>

<p>Early Christmas morning, Robert woke; and what do you
think he saw by the side of his bed? Well, it was a fine
sled, painted red, with thick iron runners.</p>

<p>Robert could hardly believe his eyes. He jumped out
of bed, and dressed himself. Then, as the morning light
grew clearer, he saw other presents,&mdash;a beautiful pair of
skates, a rabbit that could hop out of a box, but was not
alive, a bat and ball, a bag of marbles, a fine pocket-knife,
a silver pencil-case, a ship all rigged, a paint-box, and many
more things that I cannot name.</p>

<p>"And all these things are mine!" cried Robert. But he
then remembered his promise to Santa Claus, and sighed.
"What a nice pair of skates!" thought he. "And this knife
and this pencil-case,&mdash;they are just what I want. Will
Santa Claus ever find it out, I wonder, if I keep them?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>It was only for a moment that the little boy hesitated.
Then he put his hand on his sled, and said, "No! a promise
is a promise. Here is what I asked for. I sent word to Mr.
Santa Claus what I would do; and it would be mean now if
I were to break my promise."</p>

<p>I am glad to say that Robert distributed all the presents,
except the sled, among the boys and girls of his acquaintance,
whose parents were too poor to spend money on
Christmas-gifts.</p>

<p>Uncle Charles was so much pleased with Robert's conduct,
that he bought the prettiest pair of skates he could find, and
put them on Robert's feet, and told him they were his own.</p>

<h2>PIGGY'S VISIT.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> stood by the table kneading dough. Annie was
washing Dolly's apron. Bobby was making a pasteboard
wagon for Dolly. Clara was rocking the cradle, which was
baby Dan's carriage to the land of Nod. Cook was paring
the "taters," as she called them. Mother sat quietly sewing
on Annie's sack. How still every thing was!</p>

<p>All at once piggy put his nose in at the door with an
"Ugh, ugh! May I come in?"</p>

<p>Mary let some flour fall; Annie hugged Dolly closely,
perhaps to keep piggy from eating her; cook got the
broom; baby screamed; and Clara laughed aloud.</p>

<p>Mother took the baby, and sat still. Where was piggy?
and where was Bob?</p>

<p>Down came the broom where piggy had been; but piggy
was scampering down the path, with Bob at his heels, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
in a few minutes piggy was in his pen in the far corner of
the lot, grunting with fear and weariness.</p>

<img src="images/illus23.png" width="400" height="306" alt="Piggy at the door" title="Piggy at the door" />
</div>

<p>Bob came up, and closed the door of the pen, "Piggy,"
said Bob, "naughty piggy, to come where you are not
wanted! I should think you would like to stay in your own
house, so neat and comfortable."</p>

<p>"Ugh, ugh!" said piggy.</p>

<p>"Oh! you were lonesome, were you?" said Bob. "You
thought it was no more than civil to call on your neighbors.
You wanted to show us that you were not too proud to be
sociable. Next time please to send in your card first."</p>

<p>"Ugh, ugh!" said piggy.</p>

<p>That was more than a week ago; and piggy has staid at
home since then. Perhaps he is waiting for us to return
his call.</p>

<p>Now, how many persons have I told you about?</p>

flag do some good. This was
the plan: When his father had
any bundles to send to Boston,
Charles ran down to the street,
and put his flag in the fence.</div>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The rainstorms are pouring,</span><br />
And the waves are like mountains to see.<br />

When the sky is all fair and serene,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sun shining brightly,</span><br />

<h2>HOW SMART MANAGED THE SHEEP.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Smart</span> was a sheep-dog that belonged to a Mr. Scott, who
lived in Scotland. On the large sheep-farms of that country
a single shepherd often has the charge of from three to
six thousand sheep.</p>

<p>The shepherd has with him usually two dogs; of these,
one is the driving-out, the other the bringing-in dog. To
the first the shepherd points out a number of sheep, and
informs him by voice and action that he wishes him to drive
them to a distant hill. The dog at once does as he is bid.</p>

<p>In the same way the shepherd informs the second dog<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
that a lot of sheep on a distant hill are to be brought to the
spot on which he then stands; and off runs the second dog,
and brings the sheep to his master.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 249px;">
<img src="images/illus30.png" width="249" height="300" alt="Smart watching the sheep" title="Smart watching the sheep" />
</div>

<p>Mr. Scott's dog Smart was so trained, that he would never
frighten the sheep. In driving a flock from one pasture to
another, the sheep would often take a wrong turn, and then
scamper off as fast as they could go.</p>

<p>At such times it is the custom of shepherds to send a dog
after them at the top of his speed. He is not long in overtaking
them, when, if the weather be warm, and the lanes
narrow and dusty, the sheep are much frightened, and not
infrequently are hurt.</p>

<p>Now, to prevent this, Mr. Scott would order his dog<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Smart to go the other side of the hedge or fence, saying,
"Now, go ahead, and bring them back, and take care not to
frighten them."</p>

<p>Smart would trot off so that the sheep should not see
him, and in a short time would peep over or through the
hedge. At length, when he had satisfied himself that he
had got ahead of the sheep, he would come out gently in
advance of them, and drive them back down the lane so
quietly as not to give them the least alarm.</p>

<p>Smart would never attempt to go ahead of a flock in the
usual way: he would manage so that the sheep should not
know he was trying to get ahead of them. The picture
will show you how he did. Was he not a wise dog?</p>

<h2>HOW TWO BOYS PASSED CHRISTMAS<br />
MORNING.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were two little boys who were cousins. One was
named Richard; the other was named Paul. Richard lived
where he could see from his chamber-window the Atlantic
Ocean. There was a thick clump of trees at the back of his
house; and in winter the ground in front would be often
covered with snow.</p>

<p>Paul lived in Southern California, where, from his chamber-window,
he could see the Pacific Ocean. He had a
brother Harry and two sisters. It never snowed where he
was: and he had no use for skates; for the water never
froze.</p>

<p>Richard had a sister Mary, of whom he was very fond.
Here is what Richard wrote to his Cousin Paul about his
way of passing Christmas morning:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wish you and Harry and the girls had been with us;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
for we had a good time on the ice. I'll tell you what we
did. As soon as we had breakfasted, I got out my sled
'Dauntless,' and told Mary to wrap up, and bring her skates
along.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus32.png" width="400" height="296" alt="House in the snow" title="House in the snow" />
</div>

<p>"She got ready, and took her seat on the sled. Tiger
began to bark; for he saw that a frolic was on foot. Off we
started to the pond. A dozen boys and girls were there
before us. They had made a fire on an island in the middle
of the pond. It was a cool, bracing day; but the wind didn't
blow.</p>

<p>"Our island we called 'The Isle of Refuge,' Julia Peters
named it. She has a knack at inventing names. The island
is fifteen feet long by twelve wide; and it has a rock that
makes a capital fireplace.</p>

<p>"We had a fine time. All the girls could skate well.
Nobody broke through the ice; but some of us had falls.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
No harm done. We thought of you, and wondered what
you and the rest of our cousins in California might be about.
I hope you will write me as you promised."</p>

<p>Well, Paul <i>did</i> write; and here is an extract from his letter:
"We all woke early; for father had been out in a boat
with some friends all night, and we were expecting them
back. We dressed, and went down to the beach; and there,
right in the face of the sun, we saw father's boat.</p>

<p>"Harry had a spyglass; and he knelt on the beach, and
spied out father on the deck of the boat. Mother and the
girls waved their handkerchiefs, while I jumped and shouted.</p>

<p>"It was a mild, lovely, morning,&mdash;so mild, that we wore our
straw hats and light clothing. We thought of you; and I
said, 'Wouldn't Richard like to be here, where Christmas
morning opens as soft and warm as a day in June?'</p>

<p>"But Harry cried out, 'Don't you believe it! Richard is
either coasting or skating; and I wish I were with him.
How I would enjoy a high old time on the ice, and then
a coast down hill over the snow! That's the fun for me!'</p>

<p>"'Well,' said mother, 'I am well content with this bright
sunrise and this delicious air. I shall not sigh for the snow
and ice.' 'Nor I!' 'Nor I!' shouted Laura and Kate: so
you see Harry was in a minority.</p>

<p>"Father soon landed in his boat; and then we all went
back to the house and had breakfast. After breakfast we
had a merry time at croquet, and then a still merrier time

you have not forgotten your promise to write me."</p>

<p>Here were two little boys belonging to the same grand
country,&mdash;one writing from the shore of the Pacific, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
all was balm and sunshine on Christmas morning; and the
other writing from the shore of the Atlantic, where it was
cold enough to skate. What an idea does this give of the
extent of our favored land, and the wonderful variety of its
climates and its products!</p>

<h2>WHY THE HORSES JUMPED OVERBOARD.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were two fine horses. Here is a picture of them.
One was named Albion, and the other Erin. Albion was
the white horse, of course; for the word "Albion" is derived
from the Latin <i>albus</i>, white; and England got the name of
Albion because of its white chalky cliffs by the sea.</p>

<p>Well, these two fine horses belonged to Mr. Ducrow, who
kept a circus. They were on board a steamer bound for
Newhaven in England. They had been out at sea several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
days; and they longed to have a frolic on the green land,
and have a bite at some good crisp grass.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus35.png" width="350" height="367" alt="Horses swimming" title="Horses swimming" />
</div>

<p>So, when they saw the land quite near, what did they do
but leap overboard, and swim towards it! But the groom
who took care of them sprang instantly after them, and
kept swimming beside them, guiding and cheering them.</p>

<p>As soon as they got out of the water, and felt the green
turf under them, they snorted and gambolled, and showed
their joy in various ways. How nice the green grass must
have tasted to them! and what fun it must have been to
lie down and have a good roll on the ground!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
